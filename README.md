# TUL-Mod
A simple minecraft mod using Forge that adds a new type of tool, the TUL.
The TUL combines the functionality of swords and pickaxes to a single package which can save inventory space.
It has its won texture and is craftable in wood, stone, iron, gold and diamond and is also upgradable to netherite using the smithing table.
## Crafting
In the crafting table use the following pattern:

![crafting recipe](/images/crafting.png) ![crafting recipe](/images/goldcrafting.png) ![crafting recipe](/images/ironcraft.png) ![crafting recipe](/images/stonecrafting.png) ![crafting recipe](/images/woodcrafting.png)

Replace the diamonds with (wood, stone, gold, iron) to get a TUL in the respective material.
The netherite TUL can be obtained by upgrading the diamond TUL with a netherite ingot at a smithing table.

## Installation
1) Have an installed version of Minecraft with Forge for version 1.16.1
2) Download the .jar file from the "Release" tab on the right
2) Drop the .jar file in the mods folder of the installed Minecraft with Forge version.
